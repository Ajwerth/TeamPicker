# Team Picker 1.0
 Team picker is a small little app that uses Jupyter Notebooks and [pydfs-lineup-optimizer](https://github.com/DimaKudosh/pydfs-lineup-optimizer.git) to help you pick an optimized lineup for DFS.

## Getting Started
To get team picker to work you will need to have jupyter installed. Once you have jupyter installed you can simply run 
`jupyter notebook` in the TeamPicker directory and it will start up a notebook at http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Picker.ipynb
